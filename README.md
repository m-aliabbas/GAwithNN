In this repo we are going to train a Deep Neural Network on Software Defect Dataset CM1.
For training purpose we use Keras with TensorFlow backend and for feature selection among differnet feature to aquire better accuracy we use Genetic Algorithm.
We achive 89% accuracy on training while 87% accuracy on test dataset.
Python Script along with result obtain from Genetic algorithm on Neural Network and Neural Network training history is uploaded along accuracy and loss graph.
Stay tunned.
